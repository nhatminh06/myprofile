                        <p><em>This is a living plan. I'll adapt it as I meet new mentors, join clubs, or uncover better learning paths. Future Minh, keep iterating!</em></p>

                    <p>When I first arrived at the University of Minnesota, I knew I wanted to work in tech, but I wasn't sure exactly where. After exploring different areas and building projects, I discovered DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering — the perfect intersection of systems thinking, automation, and problem-solving. This plan maps out how I'm using my CS and Math double major to build the foundation for a career in infrastructure engineering.</p>

                    <h2>Year 1 — Foundations & Habits ✅</h2>

                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Completed | <strong>Credits:</strong> 34 | <strong>GPA:</strong> 4.000</p>

                    <p>My freshman year was about building strong fundamentals. I focused on getting comfortable with the basics — calculus, discrete math, and introductory programming — while starting to explore what happens behind the scenes when code runs in production.</p>

                    <h3>Academic Foundation</h3>

                    <ul>

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Physics:</strong> PHYS 1301W (Physics I with Writing)
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Why it matters:</em> Understanding systems, forces, and interactions at a fundamental level helps me think about how components interact in distributed systems.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>General Education:</strong> GEOG 1372, GEOG 1502, HIST 1811, WRIT 1301 (Libed Requiremnet)

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Technical Skills I Built</h3>

                    <p>Beyond coursework, I focused on practical DevOps fundamentals:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Git & GitHub fluency</strong> — Version control is the foundation of collaboration</li>
                        <li><strong>Linux fundamentals + shell scripting</strong> — Most infrastructure runs on Linux; automation starts with scripts</li>
                        <li><strong>Intro to networking</strong> — Understanding OSI layers, TCP/IP, DNS helps debug connectivity issues</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Projects & Experiments</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Automated my dotfile setup with shell scripts (my first taste of infrastructure automation)</li>
                        <li>Built this personal site and deployed it with GitHub Actions (learning CI/CD early)</li>
                        <li>Containerized a simple Go app with Docker (understanding isolation and portability)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

                    <p>The biggest lesson from Year 1: <strong>consistency beats intensity</strong>. I learned to study regularly rather than cramming, which helped me maintain a 4.0 GPA while still having time for side projects. I also discovered that I learn best by building things — reading about Docker is one thing, but actually containerizing an app makes concepts stick.</p>

                    <h2>Year 2 — Tooling & Automation 🚧</h2>

                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> In Progress | <strong>Planned Credits:</strong> 34</p>

                    <p>Sophomore year is where theory meets practice. I'm taking courses that directly relate to understanding how computers work at a low level, which is essential for optimizing systems and debugging production issues.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Path?</h2>

                    <p>Some people ask why I'm pursuing a double major in CS and Math when I could focus solely on practical DevOps skills. Here's my thinking:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Deep understanding beats surface knowledge:</strong> When a production system fails at 3 AM, I want to understand what's happening at every layer — from the application code to the network stack to the operating system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics is the language of systems:</strong> Probability and statistics help me make data-driven decisions about reliability. Optimization theory helps me allocate resources efficiently. Linear algebra underlies machine learning applications in monitoring.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-term career flexibility:</strong> A strong theoretical foundation means I can adapt as technology evolves. The tools change (Terraform today, something new tomorrow), but the principles remain.</li>
                        <li><strong>I genuinely enjoy it:</strong> I find beauty in elegant algorithms, clean proofs, and well-designed systems. This isn't just a career path — it's what I'm passionate about.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Resources & Learning</h2>

                    <p>Beyond coursework, I'm continuously learning through:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Books:</strong> <em>The Site Reliability Engineering Book</em>, <em>The Phoenix Project</em>, <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Podcasts:</strong> <em>Software Engineering Daily</em>, <em>The Changelog</em>, <em>Kubernetes Podcast</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Local DevOps meetups, online forums, open-source contributions</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Building projects, contributing to open source, writing about what I learn</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>This plan is a living document. As I progress, I'll update it with:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Actual course experiences and what I learned</li>
                        <li>Projects I've completed</li>
                        <li>Internships and industry experiences</li>
                        <li>Adjustments based on new interests or opportunities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The goal isn't to follow this plan perfectly — it's to have a clear direction while remaining flexible enough to adapt when I discover better paths or new interests.</p>

                    <p>If you're a fellow student or early-career engineer on a similar journey, I'd love to connect and learn together. Building infrastructure is a team sport, and the best learning happens in community.</p>
