My first year at a foreign country, stayed far away from my family, girlfriend, friends, and all memorable things, has come to the end. Now, at the time I wrote this blog, I'm sitting at my desk and typing each line for you to know more about my person. 


## Introduction

My name is Pham Nhat Minh, a 19-year-old teenager who loves coding and playing football, and I am Vietnamese. Everything was so fast. I remember that last year, I said "Goodbye" to my parents, sibling, and cousins to go study abroad at Ha Noi International Airport, then about 2 months ago, I came back to my country. That is damn fast. Time just flies but I don't know what I have done until now.
